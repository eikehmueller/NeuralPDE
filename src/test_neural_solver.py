"""This module is for testing the Neural solver module. The tests here are

1: check that the neighbouring cells have a shared edge
2: check that input and output have shape (n_patches, d_lat)
3: check that input and output have shape (1, n_patches, d_lat)
4: check that input and output have shape (batchsize, n_patches, d_lat)
5: check that an averaging function returns the expected result
