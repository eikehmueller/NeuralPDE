    """Collective decoding from latent space

    The input X has shape

        (B,n_{patches},d_{lat}) or (n_{patches}, d_{lat})

    where the batch-dimension is of size B. d_{lat} = d_{lat}^{dynamic} + d_{lat}^{ancillary}
    is the dimension of the latent space, consisting of both dynamic and ancillary variables.

    The output has shape

        (B,n_{out},n_{dof}) or (n_{out}, n_{dof})

    where n_{out} is the number of output functions.

    To achieve this, each of the input function is first mapped to a function on
    the patch covering with a learnable embedding.

    This embedding has block-structure in the sense that

        [b,i,:] gets mapped to [b,,:,i,:]

    by applying decoder_model for each sample b and each patch i. This will result in a number
    of functions on the patch covering, which is a tensor of shape

        (B,n_{out},n_{patches},n_{dof per patch})

    where n_{patches} and n_{dof per patch} depend on the SphericalPatchCovering. This tensor
    is then mapped to a tensor of shape (B,n_{out},n_{dof}) by using the adjoint of a
    projection to a VOM.
